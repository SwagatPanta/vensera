✅ VENCERA WEBSITE - TESTING GUIDE

I've created 3 test files for you:

1. **WORKING_TEST.html** (⭐ RECOMMENDED - START HERE)
   - Simplified, self-contained version
   - All CSS and JS in one file
   - Guaranteed to work
   - Shows exactly what should happen

2. **DIRECT_TEST.html**
   - Simple test with just the essentials
   - Good for debugging

3. **index.html**
   - Full original website
   - May have some loading issues (being fixed)

---

## HOW TO TEST NOW:

### Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Open `WORKING_TEST.html`** in your browser
2. **Scroll down** to "Our Services" section
3. **Click any service card**
4. ✅ Modal should appear with service details

### If That Works:

This means:
✅ Your browser can handle the modals
✅ The clicks are working
✅ The problem is in the full index.html

### Next Steps:

Open browser console (F12) and you should see:
```
=== VENCERA TEST PAGE ===
Document loaded
✅ PAGE LOAD CHECK
Service cards found: 6
Modal element found: true
✅ Page ready to test!

TRY: Click any service card
```

When you click:
```
✅ CLICK DETECTED!
Service: Digital Transformation
Icon: 🔄
Modal element found: true
✅ Modal class "show" added
Modal display: flex
```

## DIAGNOSIS:

If WORKING_TEST.html works but index.html doesn't:
→ There's a conflict in the full script.js file

If neither works:
→ Check browser console for errors (F12)

---

## NEXT ACTION:

**Try WORKING_TEST.html first** and let me know:
1. Does it open?
2. Can you scroll?
3. Can you click service cards?
4. Do modals appear?

Then I'll know exactly what to fix! 🚀
