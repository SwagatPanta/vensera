# ✅ Vensera Tech Website - Problem Solved!

## 🎯 What Was the Issue?

**Problem**: Service cards were not clickable
**Root Cause**: Event listeners were being attached before the HTML elements were loaded

## ✓ How It Was Fixed

### The Solution
Wrapped all JavaScript initialization in a **DOMContentLoaded event** that waits for the HTML to fully load before attaching event listeners.

### Code Changes Made

**Before (Didn't Work):**
```javascript
// These ran immediately, before HTML loaded
document.querySelectorAll('.service-card').forEach(card => {
    card.addEventListener('click', function() { ... });
});
```

**After (Works Now):**
```javascript
function initializeWebsite() {
    // This runs AFTER HTML is loaded
    initializeEventListeners();
    initSmoothScrolling();
    initFormHandling();
    // ... etc
}

// Wait for DOM to be ready
if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeWebsite);
} else {
    initializeWebsite();
}
```
